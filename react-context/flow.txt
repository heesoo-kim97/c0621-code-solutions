How the flow works

We first go through the mounting phase where we check App.componentDidMount(). Through App.componentDidMount() we can check
if the token is stored in localStorage and the isAuthorizing is set to false

We now go to App.render() and since is Authorizing is falsy value we continue on render method. We return React Elements in the App.render()
After React elements are rendered we pass App.state.user


User can Sign up
  - When user clicks register button, it changes the hash value to '#sign-up'. This will lead to another rendering of App.
    Therefore, we go to App.render() again

User can Sign in
  - After rendering the page, the handleSignOut() method is called

User can stay signed in
  - when page is reloaded - componentDidMount will called again which will check for token in localStorage
  If token is there, state holds the user information and the page is rerendered like the user is signing in so that user stays signed in.

User can sign out
  - When user signs out - componentDidMount is called again, but will check for token in localStorage which is not present. And when the sign out button is clicked the onClick event handler fires
  and handleSignOut() method gets called
